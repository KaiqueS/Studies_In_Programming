Roughly speaking, this means that, when we create a new variable and assign to it an old existing variable, we are taking the value of the latter and using it on the former, just like in C++ when dealing with normal( not reference nor pointer ) variables. This constrasts with some assignments in Python, where, depending on the type and mutability of the entity that we are labelling with a variable, assigning another variable to an existing one is the same as providing a new label for that old variable, so that changes in the former WILL affect the later, because we are not only handling the value of the former, we are in fact just giving another label, i.e. new variable, to it.

Then, we get a second value y, and put it \"on the top\" of x. When we are finished using x and y, we will clean the memory beginning from the value at the top of the stack, i.e., y. We call this <b>last in, first out</b>. Adding values to the stack is called <b>pushing onto the stack</b>, and doing so is less costly than pushing to the heap, because the place where the entity must be store is readily availabe( the top of the stack ).

This allocation, the size of the portion, varies according to the type of the entity that we are storing in memory. More specifically, this portion of memory will be just big enough to hold the entity. After allocating, the system marks the location where the entity was allocated as being used, and, then, returns a <b>Pointer</b>, i.e., the <b>memory address</b> of that location. Handling heap memory is called <b>allocating</b>.\n",

Whenever we need the value of the latter, we must follow the address given by the <b>pointer</b> into the heap memory, and, from there, get the value of the object. Following the address makes accessing heap memory slower than accessing stack data, because, besides finding the pointer, we must, as said, follow it, and then access the entity.\n",

    "The motivation is given by the different behaviors themselves. Why, like in Python, entities of some types are handled differently by the language? Why the mere fact that an entity is of some type, instead of another, changes a basic behavior of the language? All these questions, if you want to research further, are related to <b>variable binding, data binding,</b> and <b>ownership</b>. More specifically in Rust, we also are bringing to the table the concept of <b>borrowing</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of types not merely as representations and data, but also as interfaces, and think about how those interfaces are implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "About the answer, well, it lies in how is <b>String</b>, and, more generaly, types, are handled by memory and implemented in Rust. Before we proceed, remember, we have <b>heap</b> and <b>stack</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Rust, <b>String</b> is made up of a <b>pointer</b>, a <b>length</b>, and a <b>capacity</b>. All three are stored in the <b>stack</b>. But, the <b>pointer</b>, even though in the stack, points to a memory in the <b>heap</b>. What do you think would happen if we created another instance of <b>String</b> and assigned to it another existing <b>String</b>?\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard answer is: we would be assigning to this new instance the same states of the data members of the previous instance. I.e., we would be \"checking the values\" of each data member, \"getting\" these values, and putting them into the data members of the new instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The thing is: one of those data members is a <b>pointer</b>. Its states, or values, are <b>addresses</b> to locations in mmemory large enough to fit an entity of the type handled by the pointer. When we copy a pointer, i.e., we are copying the <b>address</b> in memory pointed by the pointer, and not the states or values of the entity in this memory address. So, this new instance of <b>String</b> will handle the same, yes, the <b>SAME</b>, address and content of the previous instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice one thing: I used the word <b>previous</b> instead of existing. That is because there is a potential problem with the presented behavior. If two instances are handling the very same resource through a pointer, and given that pointers' resources must be freed when the instances go out of scope, whatever instance is freed first, we will inevitably, when freeing the late instance, be freeing an <b>already freed memory</b>. This is known as <i>double free</i> error, and Rust handles it by what we call a <b>move</b> in C++. Whenever the second instance gets its value from the first, the latter is set into an invalid state, and is not considered to be an owner of the resource anymore, meaning that the second instance is the sole owner of the resource now. This frees( no pun intended ) Rust from the obligation to free the memory allocated for the first instance, and, thus, avoid the <i>double free</i> error. Also, <i>moving</i> is way cheaper than </i>deep copy</i>, because, well, it simply does not perform all the operations required to copy each data member of a type. It just \"gives\" the states to the new instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "So: the type of data members and its interfaces. Care about that. This is what will determine what kind of behavior we will have when performing some operations, and, from this behavior, we can at least have a good guess of what a type is doing under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Rust does not performs <b>deep copies</b>. I.e., it will not copy all the states of the data members of a type. But, if we DO want it, we might do so by using <b>.clone()</b>, which must be provided by the type we wanto to copy. Also, we have <b>Copy</b> and <b>Drop</b> traits to signal whether we can perform <b>deep copy</b> or <b>move</b> on a type. <b>Drop</b> signal a no for <b>Deep Copy</b>. "

This is semantically different from what references do in Rust, even though the behavior of references in function, both for C++ and Rust, are in effect the same. The point here is: in C++, references from entity to entity promotes a sharing of ownerships. In Rust, references in function parameters guarantees and maintains exclusivity over ownership, i.e., it is a way for we <b>not</b> to transfer ownerships.

    "To see this more clearly: in C++, when we pass an argument to a parameter that is not a reference, the entity passed as argument has its value copied into another entity of the same type. Anything that the function does will affect this copy, not the original entity. The lifetime of the copy ends with the function, whereas the base entity remain alive after the function end. When we pass by reference in C++, we allow for the function to handle directly the argument entity itself. But, as said before, even though we can change the state of the entity, we cannot change its lifetime. So, even if invalid, the entity will exit the function \"alive\". In Rust, passing by reference passes the entity itself, just as in C++, but, it will also signal a \"do not mess with this entity's lifetime\" to the function. I.e., in Rust, there is more to references than just resources!\n",

The number of bytes for an element in a <b>String</b> is not fixed, it can change according to our scalar values, so, even if we apparently have a number x of characters on screen, we might have 2x, 3x, $\\frac{x}{3}$, etc., bytes reserved for each letter by the <b>String</b>. When we index our <b>String</b>, we access those bytes, and the index might be accessing only a portion of the bytes used by the letter. This portion might not have a valid Unicode scalar representation, thus, it will not return a valid value. Considering this possibility, it was decided not to allow for indexing on <b>String</b> at all. Check p.141 to better vizualise this problem.\n",

The possibility of interpreting <b>String</b> in any of those ways makes it possible for our programs to choose the interpretation it needs( KLABNIK, 2019 ).\n",
