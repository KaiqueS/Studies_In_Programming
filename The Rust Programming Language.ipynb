Roughly speaking, this means that, when we create a new variable and assign to it an old existing variable, we are taking the value of the former and using it on the former, just like in C++ when dealing with normal( not reference nor pointer ) variable. This constrasts with some assignments in Python, where, depending on the type of the object that we are labelling with a variable, assigning another variable to an existing one is the same as providing a new label for that old variable, so that changes in the former WILL affect the later, because we are not only handling the value of the former, we are in fact just giving another label, i.e. new variable, to it. We will get back to this later.\n",
