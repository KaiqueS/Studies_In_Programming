# Studies_In_Programming
Code &amp; Notes of programming languages studies

### A quick update: People, my undergraduate classes resumed. I WILL keep updating The Rust Programming Languange, I guarantee that I will not drop it, but I will need to change my current schedule. I will try to plan a new schedule this weekend. Sorry for the lack of updates this week.

I only update The C++ Programming Language code & notes at mondays and wednesdays!

Rust: I will update every weekday, except for wednesdays.

If you disagree with anything said here or if you find any problem, please do open an issue!

TODO: Add notes & codes for chapters 1-8, The C++ Programming Language
  -> in progress


I am using Xeus-Cling( https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling ) kernel for C++( 17 ) and EvCxR( https://github.com/google/evcxr/blob/master/evcxr_jupyter/README.md ) for Rust

But all code provided here is compilable by any recent compiler, for both C++ and Rust.
