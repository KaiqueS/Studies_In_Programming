# Studies_In_Programming
Code &amp; Notes of programming languages studies

I am using Xeus-Cling( https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling ) kernel for C++( 17 ) and EvCxR( https://github.com/google/evcxr/blob/master/evcxr_jupyter/README.md ) for Rust

But all code provided here is compilable by any recent compiler, for both C++ and Rust.
