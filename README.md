# Studies_In_Programming
Code &amp; Notes of programming languages studies

I only update The C++ Programming Language code & notes at mondays and wednesdays!

Rust I will update every sat and sundays.

TODO: Add notes & codes for chapters 1-8, The C++ Programming Language

I am using Xeus-Cling( https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling ) kernel for C++( 17 ) and EvCxR( https://github.com/google/evcxr/blob/master/evcxr_jupyter/README.md ) for Rust

But all code provided here is compilable by any recent compiler, for both C++ and Rust.
