# Notice: I will not be updating The C++ Programming Language at least until the end of the next week.
# I have some work to do on my Master's, because my classes are resuming from today. BUT, I will be
# continuing with The Rust Programming Language normally. Thanks for the understanding.

I only update The C++ Programming Language code & notes at mondays and wednesdays!

Rust: I will update every weekday!

TODO: Add notes & codes for chapters 1-8, The C++ Programming Language
  -> in progress


I am using Xeus-Cling( https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling ) kernel for C++( 17 ) and EvCxR( https://github.com/google/evcxr/blob/master/evcxr_jupyter/README.md ) for Rust

But all code provided here is compilable by any recent compiler, for both C++ and Rust.
